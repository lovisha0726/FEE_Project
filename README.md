Team members:
1. Manakpreet kaur (Lead Developer): Developers utilize Git for version control, collaborating on code changes and managing the software development process,role involves creating and updating branches, committing changes, resolving merge conflicts, and pushing code to the central repository. Developers also review each other's code through pull requests, provide feedback, and ensure that changes are integrated smoothly into the codebase. By leveraging Git effectively, developers contribute to the project's success by maintaining a well-organized and coherent codebase, enabling seamless collaboration, and tracking changes throughout the development lifecycle.

2.. Madhu(Tester): Tester contribute by ensuring the quality and integrity of the codebase through comprehensive testing,collaborate with developer to understand new features and changes, creating test cases and scenarios to validate functionality. Tester also utilize Git for version control, branching off to test new features or bug fixes independently, ensuring that the main codebase remains stable.Also report bugs and issues found during testing, work with developer to resolve them, and verify fixes through regression testing. By leveraging Git alongside testing practices, testers play a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and quality of the software throughout its development lifecycle.

3.Lovisha(Manager):The manager typically oversees the project's overall direction, coordinates team efforts, and ensures that deadlines and objectives are met. They may define branching strategies, manage repositories, and resolve conflicts. Additionally, managers facilitate communication among team members, track progress, and prioritize tasks to ensure efficient collaboration and successful project completion.
Team Leadership and Coordination, and ensures quality standards. Skills : Detail-oriented, experienced in software testing methodologies, excellent communication skills for providing feedback.

Project overview:

The polling and survey application form project entails the creation of a comprehensive platform facilitating the seamless creation, distribution, and analysis of polls and surveys. Designed to cater to diverse needs such as market research, opinion gathering, and data collection, the application will offer features including user authentication, customizable poll/survey creation, multiple distribution channels, organized response collection, robust analytics and reporting, an administration panel, and scalability. Developed using modern web technologies with a focus on usability, performance, and security, the project aims to empower users to gather valuable insights and make informed decisions through efficient and user-friendly polling and surveying capabilities.

Project Goals:

1.User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for both creating and participating in polls/surveys, ensuring a positive user experience.
2.Customization: Enable users to customize polls/surveys with various question types, formatting options, and branding elements to meet their specific needs and preferences.
3.Efficient Distribution: Implement multiple distribution channels such as email, social media, and direct links to enable users to reach a wide audience effectively.
4.Accurate Response Collection: Ensure accurate and organized collection of responses from participants, maintaining data integrity and reliability.


In the first version of the polling and survey application, the primary focus is on establishing the foundational structure and design using basic HTML and CSS. This version aims to create static web pages for survey creation, distribution, and submission, focusing on layout and styling to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

In the second version, JavaScript is introduced to enhance the functionality and interactivity of the application. This includes implementing dynamic features such as form validation, real-time updates, and interactive elements to improve the user experience and streamline the survey process.

In the third version, Bootstrap is incorporated into the project to leverage its pre-designed components and responsive grid system, facilitating faster development and ensuring consistency across different devices and screen sizes. This version involves refactoring the existing codebase to utilize Bootstrap's CSS classes and JavaScript plugins, enhancing the overall aesthetic and usability of the application in a more formalized and structured manner.
